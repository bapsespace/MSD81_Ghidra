IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ!

If you are NOT creating a bin using any of the MHD+ features (antilag, flexfuel, mapswitch, 3D boost ceiling, custom WGDC control, etc), then you must use the _LEGACY.xdf for your ROM version.  These will eventually be deprecated and removed.

For custom tunes utilizing any MHD+ feature, you must use the newly updated main XDFs.  Any tables from the _LEGACY xdf that are not in the new main XDFs were intentionally removed, and their CAL space is now use for something else.
